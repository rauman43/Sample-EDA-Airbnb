 # **Problem Statement**
Investigate and predict bike sharing demand based on a dataset containing temporal, meteorological and categorical information. Explore the relationships between factors such as date, temperature, humidity and categorical variables like seasons and holidays to develop a model that accurately predicts rented bike counts. Identify key patterns and trends in bike usage to optimize service planning, resource allocation and enhance user experience for the bike sharing service.
# **Project Summary**

As we all know, bike sharing is a kind of transportation where a person or group of people can rent a conventional or electrical bike and use it to move around the city or its environs for as little as one hour, one day, or one month, depending on their needs.

With respect to market share, the bike sharing system is estimated to have a global market share of around 3.39 billion dollars in 2019 and is expected to reach 6.98 billion dollars by 2027, growing at an approximate compound annual growth rate of 14% between 2020 and 2027.

Numerous elements, including cheap bike rentals, rising capital expenditures, the release of e-bikes onto the market, technology advancements, and government initiatives to create various bike-sharing programs Throughout the anticipated year, infrastructure has expanded the overall market share and given rise to a number of prospects. However, some of the main factors that may prevent the anticipated market growth are the surge in bike theft and the high initial investment.
Leading to the need for a more efficient and effective way to manage the bike sharing operations. Accurately predicting bike demand is crucial for optimizing fleet management, ensuring the availability of bikes at high-demand locations, and reducing waste and costs.

In this project, we conducted a thorough exploration of the data science lifecycle. Beginning with data understanding and wrangling, we progressed through extensive Data Visualization and Storytelling, creating 15 charts to unravel complex relationships. Hypothesis testing and feature engineering enriched our analyses, setting the stage for three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting.

Our models were evaluated using key metrics, including Mean Squared Error and R-squared Score, providing insights into their predictive capabilities. Through meticulous data preprocessing and feature selection, we optimized the dataset for model compatibility, showcasing our proficiency in the entire data science process.

# **Conclusion**


In summary, the Gradient Boosting Regression model demonstrated superior performance among the evaluated models, showcasing lower errors and a higher R-squared Score. This model was chosen for its ability to accurately predict the target variable. Future work could involve feature engineering and exploring additional models for improved accuracy. The assignment underscores the significance of robust evaluation metrics, highlighting the importance of R-squared Score in making business impact predictions. The chosen model provides a promising foundation for real-world applications.
