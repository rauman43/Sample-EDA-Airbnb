Data cleaning:Data cleaning entails removing any incomplete or missing information and making sure the data is in an easily analyzed format.

Data Visualization:Plots and charts can be used to visualize data and help spot trends and patterns. For instance, you may make scatter plots to show correlations between distinct variables or histograms to comprehend the distribution of different continuous data, such as price and the number of reviews.

Data synthesis: To comprehend the relationships between various variables and summarize the data, apply statistical techniques. For example, to comprehend the distribution of continuous data, such as price and number of reviews, you could compute means, medians, and standard deviations.
