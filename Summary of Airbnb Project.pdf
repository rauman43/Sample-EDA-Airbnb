Airbnb Bookings Analysis
Summary:
The NYC Airbnb project is a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb market in New York City. It involves gathering and analyzing data related to Airbnb listings, hosts, and guests in order to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and impacts of short-term rentals in the city. The project aims to provide a better understanding of the Airbnb market in NYC and its implications for the housing market, tourism industry, and local communities.
Key Objectives:-
Here are the key steps for conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Airbnb Bookings analysis:

●	Data acquisition: Obtain a representative sample of the data from the Airbnb company, including customer demographic information, review patterns, and availability, etc.

●	Data cleaning: Remove any missing or incomplete data and ensure that the data is in a format that can be easily analyzed.

●	Data visualization: Use plots and charts to visualize the data and identify trends and patterns. For example, you might create histograms to understand the distribution of various continuous data like price, number of reviews, or scatter plots to identify correlations between different variables.

●	Data summarization: Use statistical techniques to summarize the data and understand the relationships between different variables. For example, you might calculate means, medians, and standard deviations to understand the distribution of continuous data like price and number of reviews. Overall, the goal of EDA for Airbnb booking analysis is to maximize occupancy rates, profitability, and guest satisfaction in the client's Airbnb rental business in New York City.
 
Overall, the NYC Airbnb project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Airbnb market in New York City and its impact on various aspects of the city's economy and communities. The project's findings and recommendations can inform policy decisions, facilitate informed discussions, and contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding the regulation and management of short-term rentals in NYC.
